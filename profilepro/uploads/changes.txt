Let's go ahead and meeting on GoToMeeting on Tue for our meeting. The details are below. I will call you on Skype first and we can use that for audio.

To prepare, here is the skeleton marketing site that I've been working on: www.marginmarkup.com (password: http://screencast.com/t/GVn6Y6hY). It is just the beginning but will give you a very general idea of what the product is supposed to do, who the customers are and what the general expectation is.

When we are done, I have a file that I will send to you that has all of the slides that I'm going to show you, as well as technical requirements that should be of great help.

================================================================
Sanjiv,

Below is the link for the PDF of the screens that I showed you. Please note that only pages 1-104 are applicable. 

The password for the Prototype PDF is springfield!2014 and here is a link to download (it’s too large to send): https://www.evernote.com/shard/s52/sh/2932c663-3dbd-4ed9-a4f9-f7897c53c3fc/11244f2e619bb8de0c32ffd1b4c48a31

I’ve also attached additional doc specs for you. 

I can send the Keynote file to you, as well, which will be completely interactive. You will need Keynote on a Mac in order for it to function (it won’t work as a PPT or anything else). Its only for UI testing purposes, and will also allow your guys to slice up the slides for the png images that will be needed.

Thank you,


Brett
